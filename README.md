# EnCode-DeCode
An Encoder of my thought into a manner which I can understand with ease, so that anyone else who reads will not understand thus keeping my thoughts when printed private for display.


Why:
        The reason was to write my goals in a manner that only I would be able to understand and read
        with relative ease. To anyone else they who have to take the time to figure out the process. No while the encryption
        is not advanced it gets the job done.

        Additionally it would have been easier to wrote all the goals out in plain English but that would mean others
        could see my code. Or I could have hand written the encrpted text down one by one. But that would have taken too long.

        So not only was this a good practice on my python programming but a it made the encrypting process
        of my thoughts alot faster and easier.

What App Does: 
        Takes a string passed in from the keyboard via user's input and encrpyts that value.
        There is also the ability of the app to decode the same thought and ideas that were added orignially.
